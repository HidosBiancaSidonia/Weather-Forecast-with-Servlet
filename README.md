<h1 align="center" > Weather Forecast with Servlet </h1>

<h2>Application description :</h2>

* Application, created using Java Servlet, through which a user sees the weather forecast (temperature, pressure, chances of rain, etc.) for the next 24 hours, from a certain location.
* I used only servlet, on a **Tomcat server** , without database.

<h3>Functionalities:</h3>

- [ ] the user can search the weather forecast by :
1. **location name** (the server will respond with the location or locations that best match the name entered, from where the user will choose the location they are looking for);
2. **GPS coordinates** (the server will respond with the nearest location or locations, from where the user will choose the location they are looking for).

- [ ] the weather forecast is updated from hour to hour through an asynchronous process.
